            <p class="jolly">Loppen</p>
            <p class="content-p1">Loppen is a groundbreaking digital marketplace utilizing mobile technology to offer a unique furniture shopping experience. By leveraging the phone's camera, users can generate precise 3D models of their furniture, enabling virtual placement of items within the user's living space via a mobile app. This innovative feature allows buyers to visually assess how the furniture would fit and appear in their own rooms before making a purchase.
                <p class="content-p1">
                    In addition to this technological aspect, the platform integrates a chat function facilitating seamless communication between buyers and sellers. Its website interface resembles the browsing experience of Facebook Marketplace, providing users with an intuitive platform for perusing advertisements.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p1">
                    Loppen's design draws inspiration from the nostalgic aesthetics of Windows 95, infused with a modern touch, creating a distinctive and appealing visual identity.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p1">
                    Furthermore, Loppen strives to promote sustainability by actively encouraging the purchase of pre-owned furniture. By simplifying the process for users to envision second-hand furniture in their homes, the platform aims to stimulate interest in second-hand trade, thereby reducing the necessity for new production. Through promoting this sustainable behavior, Loppen aims to mitigate negative environmental impact and raise awareness about the importance of purchasing used furniture.

                <p class="content-p1">Our task from the Opera and Visual Arena was to attract more people to the opera house using digital means. Initially exploring VR on buses, we found limited interest. So, we conceived a concept inspired by Hong Kong's Lightshow: a spectacular light display at the opera house to draw crowds. Adding an AR app enhanced the experience, offering more, akin to a drone show.
                <p class="content-p1">
                    The light show's aesthetics echoed ongoing opera performances. Post-show, projected footsteps guided visitors to an open house event at the opera, where they could delve deeper into upcoming shows and activities.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p1">
                    By merging light displays, VR, AR, and interactivity, our idea aimed to captivate and engage visitors uniquely, not only drawing them to the opera but also immersing them in the artistry of opera in a memorable way."

                    <p class="content-p1">The second assignment at school tasked us with creating an infographic about a personal topic, which felt broad and challenging initially. After contemplating various ideas and seeking guidance from my teacher, I decided to illustrate a step-by-step infographic depicting how I make pancakes—the first dish I learned to cook as a child.
                    <p class="content-p1">
                        I chose to create the entire infographic using Illustrator, a program I hadn't used before. Initially, it was challenging to navigate, but as I delved deeper, I found a passion for digital illustration and design. I developed a fondness for creating illustrated content, discovering a newfound love for artistic expression through digital mediums.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-p1">
                        I'm proud to say that I managed to craft the entire infographic without prior experience using the software. It was a learning curve that resulted in a creation I'm genuinely proud of."

                        <p class="content-p1">Our first school project was to design a food-related app, and my teammate and I conceptualized a Food App inspired by Skalmans Ät & Sov Klocka, aiming to alleviate everyday meal-related stress. The app focuses on simplifying meal planning and recipe selection.
                        <p class="content-p1">
                            The core functionality revolves around generating tailored meal lists. Users can either opt for random recipe suggestions based on their preferences or manually select dishes. Once a list is created, the app syncs with the user's fridge inventory, generating a shopping list by ticking off the available ingredients. Additionally, there's a daily menu feature suggesting meals for the day. Users can access standard recipes or opt for step-by-step visual instructions aided by simple illustrations.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content-p1">
                            Personalization is key; the app accommodates dietary preferences and allergies, filtering out recipes containing allergens or disliked ingredients. It learns from user habits and choices, refining suggestions over time.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content-p1">Moreover, the app includes a reminder feature, politely nudging users when it's time to start preparing a meal based on the set timeframe.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content-p1">This app aims to streamline meal planning, ease grocery shopping, and provide accessible, user-friendly cooking guidance, catering to individual preferences and schedules. Ultimately, it seeks to transform the culinary experience into a stress-free and enjoyable routine.
